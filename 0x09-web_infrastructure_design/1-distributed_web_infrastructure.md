A load-balancer
	- Load balancers are used to distribute network traffic across multiple servers. This helps to ensure that no single server becomes overwhelmed with requests, improving the overall performance and reliability of the system.

Set of Application Files
	- A set of application files, or code base, is a collection of source code files that make up the core functionality of a software application.

Database (MySQL)
	- MySQL is a popular and widely-used relational database management system (RDBMS) that uses Structured Query Language (SQL) to manage and manipulate data stored in databases. It is open-source software, which means that it is free to use and distribute.

How a Database Primary-Replica (Master-Slave) Cluster Works
	- In a database primary-replica cluster, one database server is designated as the primary server and is responsible for handling read and write operations. The other database servers, known as replica servers, continuously replicate the data from the primary server, ensuring that they always have an up-to-date copy of the data.

When a client wants to read or write data, it sends a request to the primary server. The primary server handles the request and then sends the updated data to the replica servers so that they can update their copies of the data. This ensures that all of the servers in the cluster have the same data, allowing for high availability and fault tolerance.

If the primary server goes down for any reason, one of the replica servers can be promoted to take its place, ensuring that the database remains available and that no data is lost. This makes primary-replica clusters a highly reliable and scalable solution for managing large amounts of data.

Security Issues (no firewall, no HTTPS)
	- Without a firewall and HTTPS, a website is vulnerable to a number of security risks. A firewall is a security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. It helps protect a website from malicious attacks by blocking incoming traffic that violates the security rules. HTTPS, on the other hand, is a protocol that encrypts the communication between a website and a users web browser, making it more difficult for hackers to intercept and read sensitive information.
